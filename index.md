# Hi, I'm Johari

Welcome to my Cybersecurity portfolio! I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a passion for protecting systems, solving complex problems, and continuously learning.

I've completed both the:

- âœ… **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, and  
- âœ… **Merit America Cybersecurity Program**

These programs gave me hands-on experience in incident response, security operations, risk management, and more.
